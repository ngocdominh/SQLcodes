SELECT MAX(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee)



** IF THERE IS MORE THAN 1 ROW, THE FOLLOWING CODE ALSO WORKS:
SELECT salary as SecondHighestSalary
FROM (SELECT salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary desc) as rn FROM Employee) a
WHERE a.rn = 2
